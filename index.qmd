## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
storms %>%
  count(name, year) %>%
  count(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1970, 2020),
                     breaks = c(1970, 1990, 2010)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA))
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
